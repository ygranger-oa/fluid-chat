# Fluid Chat

**A free, open source chat alternative to Slack.**

Channels, direct messages, threads, reactions, files, search, presence and a realtime UI —
built on Next.js, Postgres and a small Socket.IO server. Self-host it for free and own your data.

![stack](https://img.shields.io/badge/stack-Next.js%2015%20·%20Postgres%20·%20Drizzle%20·%20Socket.IO-informational)

## Quick start

```bash
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run db:generate   # only after changing src/db/schema.ts
npm run db:migrate
npm run dev           # app on http://localhost:3000
```

In two more terminals (both optional but recommended):

```bash
npm run realtime      # websocket fan-out on :3001
```

```bash
npm run worker        # scheduled messages, reminders, exports, retention, email
```

Postgres and S3-compatible object storage are the durable dependencies. Redis is optional: with
`REDIS_URL` set the realtime server fans out through Redis pub/sub (needed for more than one app
process); without it the app posts events straight to the realtime server over HTTP. Uploads are
limited to 10MB each and 100MB per workspace, and expire after 15 days.

For the full stack in containers:

```bash
docker compose up
```

## Features

**Messaging**
- Public and private channels, archived channels, channel browser, join/leave, previews of public channels
- 1:1 direct messages and group DMs (up to 9 people) with a deterministic member key — no duplicate conversations
- Threads with reply counts, participant facepiles, and "also send to channel" broadcasts
- Message editing, soft deletion, idempotent sends (`clientMessageId`) and optimistic rendering
- Formatting: `*bold*`/`**bold**`, `_italic_`, `~strike~`, `` `code` ``, code fences, quotes, lists, links
- Mentions of people (`@ada`), groups, `@here`/`@channel`/`@everyone`, and channel links (`#design`)
- Emoji reactions with a full picker, skin tones, frequently used and workspace custom emoji
- File uploads with drag-and-drop, paste, inline image rendering and per-conversation file lists
- Pins, saved items ("Later"), message sharing/forwarding, permalinks, reminders, scheduled send
- Thread following: taking part follows automatically, and you can follow or mute any thread explicitly
- Incoming webhooks so CI, alerts or scripts post into a channel under their own app identity
- Slash commands: `/me /shrug /topic /purpose /rename /invite /join /leave /archive /msg /remind /dnd /away /active /status /mute /unmute /who /help`

**Navigation and awareness**
- Unread counts, mention badges, "New messages" divider, mark unread from any message
- Activity feed (mentions, thread replies, reactions, keyword highlights), Threads view, All unreads, Later, Drafts & sent, Files, People
- Quick switcher (⌘K), keyboard shortcuts (⌘/), ↑ to edit your last message, deep-linkable permalinks
- Presence (active/away/DND/offline) with heartbeats, custom status with expiry, typing indicators per composer
- Sidebar starring, muting, per-conversation notification levels, custom sections, drafts indicators
- Workspace rail for switching tenants, and a drawer layout that makes the whole app usable on a phone

**Search**
- Postgres full-text search with `in:#channel`, `from:@person`, `has:file`, `has:link`, `is:pinned`, `before:`, `after:`, `during:` operators, sorted by recency or relevance

**Administration**
- Roles (owner/admin/member/guest), member management, seat limits and billing state
- Guests are scoped to the channels they are added to and cannot browse, join, invite or integrate
- Email invitations and reusable invite links with expiry and use limits
- Workspace settings, channel management, custom emoji, user groups, audit log
- API keys with scopes, per-key rate limits, rotation, expiry and audited creation
- Per-channel controls: posting policy, default (auto-join) channels, retention, private conversion, integrations
- Data export (JSONL + CSV + file manifest), message retention policies, per-workspace read-only mode

**Preferences**
- Light and dark themes (or match the OS), comfortable/compact density, 12h/24h clocks
- UI language preference with browser-language detection; available languages: English (`en`) and French (`fr`)
- Enter-to-send toggle, notification levels, highlight keywords, desktop notifications, sounds, session management
- Notification schedule (quiet hours) evaluated in your own timezone, honored by sounds, desktop alerts and email

## Everything is scriptable

The web client has no private endpoints. It calls `/api`, and so can you — with an API key an
admin creates in **Workspace settings → API keys**:

```bash
curl -X POST "$APP_URL/api/conversations/$CONVERSATION_ID/messages" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $FLUID_API_KEY" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"bodyText":"Deploy *v1.4.2* finished :rocket:"}'
```

Keys act as a bot identity of their own (or as you), are pinned to one workspace, hold explicit
scopes like `messages:write`, and carry their own rate limits — so an integration can post, an
agent can read and reply, and neither can quietly become an admin. A route that is not classified
into a scope fails the startup check, which is what keeps the API complete as features land.

Agents can discover the surface at runtime: `GET /api/meta/routes` lists every endpoint with the
scope it needs, and `GET /api/meta/openapi.json` returns an OpenAPI 3.1 document generated from the
same table the server enforces. Details in [API keys](docs/api-keys.md).

## Deliberately not built

These are real Slack features that need infrastructure or scope beyond a self-hosted chat server.
They are called out here rather than half-implemented:

| Feature | Why not |
| --- | --- |
| Huddles, voice and video calls | Needs SFU/WebRTC media infrastructure |
| Canvas and lists | A collaborative document editor is its own product |
| Workflow Builder | Needs a visual automation runtime; webhooks cover the common cases |
| Slack Connect (shared channels across orgs) | Requires federation between deployments |
| SSO/SAML, SCIM provisioning, Enterprise Grid | Enterprise identity integrations; the schema leaves room for them |
| Native mobile apps | The web client is responsive and works on a phone |

## Architecture

```text
src/
  app/            Next.js routes; /api/[...path] is a thin adapter over the server router
  server/
    router.ts     Tiny pattern router: "METHOD /path/:param" → handler, with a typed Context
    routes/       One module per domain (auth, users, workspaces, invites, channels,
                  conversations, messages, files, activity) — the whole HTTP surface
    services/     Reusable domain logic shared by routes, jobs and the realtime server
    jobs/         Background jobs (scheduled sends, reminders, retention, exports, email)
  client/
    api.ts        Typed API client, one method per endpoint
    store.tsx     App state, actions and realtime wiring in a single provider
    components/   UI: shell, message list, composer, panels, views, modals
  shared/         Types and the message format shared by client and server
  realtime/       Socket.IO server: room authorization, presence, typing, event relay
  db/             Drizzle schema and client
```

Design rules that keep it extensible:

- **Every query is workspace-scoped.** Permission helpers (`requireWorkspaceMember`,
  `resolveConversationAccess`) are the only way into data.
- **Writes go over HTTP, reads and events over WebSocket.** Realtime is an accelerator; if it is
  down the app still works.
- **One line per endpoint.** Adding a feature means adding a route entry and a service function.
- **Messages are plain text with stable entity tokens** (`<@uuid>`, `<#uuid|name>`, `<!here>`), so
  renames never rewrite history and exports stay greppable.
- **The client renders from DTOs**, never raw rows, so the wire format is a deliberate contract
  (`src/shared/types.ts`).
