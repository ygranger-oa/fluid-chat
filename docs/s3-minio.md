# File storage

Fluid Chat stores uploads and workspace exports in S3-compatible object storage. There is no
local-disk runtime driver or fallback.

## Cloudflare R2

Create a private R2 bucket and an API token with Object Read & Write access to that bucket, then
set:

```text
S3_ENDPOINT=https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
S3_BUCKET=fluidchat
S3_ACCESS_KEY=<R2 access key ID>
S3_SECRET_KEY=<R2 secret access key>
S3_REGION=auto
S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=false
```

The app proxies downloads through `GET /api/files/:id/download`, so the bucket should remain
private and does not need a public URL or CORS policy.

New uploads use `files/<workspace-id>/...` object keys. The API stops returning a file at its exact
expiration time, the worker deletes expired database-backed objects every five minutes, and an
hourly prefix sweep deletes aged orphan objects whose database transaction never committed. The
sweep only needs the same Object Read & Write permission used for normal file operations; the app
does not modify bucket-level lifecycle configuration.

## Limits

- Maximum file size: configured per workspace with `max_upload_mb` (10 MiB by default).
- Maximum active file storage per workspace: configured per workspace with `storage_limit_mb` (10000 MiB by default).
- Upload retention: configured per workspace with `file_retention_days` (`0` keeps files indefinitely, and is the default).
- Workspace export retention: 7 days.

Workspace admins can change file limits and upload retention from workspace settings. Workspace quota checks are serialized in Postgres, so concurrent uploads cannot exceed the cap.
Expired and deleted files do not count toward quota. Files with no expiration continue to count until deleted.

## Migrating existing local uploads

Apply the database migration first, then copy legacy files to object storage:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
npm run storage:migrate-local
```

The first run uploads and verifies every object, updates its database storage key, and leaves the
local originals in place. After checking downloads, remove those verified originals with:

```bash
npm run storage:migrate-local -- --delete-local
```

The command only deletes exact migrated file paths. It does not recursively remove the uploads
directory.

## MinIO

Docker Compose supplies MinIO, creates the `fluidchat` bucket, and configures both the app and
worker. For a separate MinIO deployment, use its endpoint and credentials and set
`S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=true`.
