# API reference

Every endpoint lives under `/api`. Requests and responses are JSON (file upload and download are
the exceptions). Errors return `{ "error": string, "code": string }` with a matching status.

Two credentials reach the same routes:

- **Session cookie** — what the web client uses. `HttpOnly`, origin checked on writes, rate limited.
- **API key** — `Authorization: Bearer fluid_sk_…`, created by a workspace admin. Scoped, pinned to
  one workspace and rate limited per key. See **[API keys](api-keys.md)**.

The tables below mark the scope each route needs. `session` means browser-only by design (credential
management), and `public` means no authentication at all. Anything else a person can do in the UI,
a key with the right scope can automate.

Print the live route table any time with:

```bash
npx tsx -e "import('./src/server/index.ts').then(m => console.log(m.routeTable.sort().join('\n')))"
```

Or fetch it, with scopes, from a running server — this is also how an agent discovers the surface:

```bash
curl -s localhost:3000/api/meta/routes | jq
curl -s localhost:3000/api/meta/openapi.json > openapi.json
```

## Auth and account

| Method | Path | Scope | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/auth/signup` | `session` | Creates the user, session and email verification token |
| POST | `/auth/login` | `session` | Email + password |
| POST | `/auth/logout` | `session` | Clears the session |
| GET | `/auth/me` | any key | Current user and workspace memberships — the whoami for a key |
| POST | `/auth/forgot-password` | `public` | Always 200; returns the token only when SMTP is unset |
| POST | `/auth/reset-password` | `public` | Consumes the token and revokes all sessions |
| POST | `/auth/change-password` | `session` | Requires the current password |
| POST | `/auth/verify-email`, `/auth/resend-verification` | `public` / `session` | Email verification |
| GET/DELETE | `/auth/sessions`, `/auth/sessions/:sessionId` | `session` | Device list and revocation |
| DELETE | `/auth/account` | `session` | Closes an account that owns no workspaces |

## Users and presence

| Method | Path | Scope | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PATCH | `/users/me` | `users:write` | Name, handle, title, pronouns, phone, timezone, avatar |
| PATCH | `/users/me/preferences` | `users:write` | Theme, language, density, notifications, keywords, skin tone |
| PUT | `/users/me/status` | `users:write` | Emoji, text, optional expiry |
| PUT | `/users/me/presence` | `users:write` | `active` / `away` / `dnd` / `offline` (+ `dndUntil`) |
| POST | `/users/me/heartbeat` | `users:write` | Keeps presence fresh; called by the client every minute |
| GET | `/users/:userId` | `users:read` | Profile, restricted to shared workspaces |
| GET | `/workspaces/:workspaceId/directory` | `users:read` | People and groups for @-autocomplete |

`/users/me*` addresses the key's own identity: for a bot key that is the bot, so a key can set its
own status and presence without touching the admin who created it.

`/users/me/preferences.language` accepts `system`, `en` or `fr`. `system` keeps the web client on
browser-language detection (`navigator.languages` / `navigator.language`) with English as the
fallback when no supported language matches.

| GET/POST | `/channels/:id/members`, DELETE `/channels/:id/members/:userId` | `channels:read` / `channels:write` | Member management |
| GET/POST | `/channels/:id/bookmarks`, DELETE `/bookmarks/:id` | `channels:read` / `channels:write` | Channel bookmark bar |

## Conversations and messages

| Method | Path | Scope | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| POST | `/messages/:id/remind` | `activity:write` | Reminder from a message |
| POST | `/messages/:id/follow` | `messages:write` | `{ state: "following" \| "muted" }` for thread notifications |
| POST | `/messages/:id/share` | `messages:write` | Forward to a conversation or people |

Posting into a public channel joins it, exactly as it does in the UI, so a key with
`messages:write` does not need `channels:write` just to announce something.

## Integrations

| Method | Path | Scope | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/channels/:id/webhooks` | `webhooks:read` | Incoming webhooks installed in a channel |
| POST | `/channels/:id/webhooks` | `webhooks:write` | Creates a bot identity and returns the URL **once** |
| DELETE | `/webhooks/:id` | `webhooks:write` | Revokes the webhook and removes its bot from the channel |
| POST | `/hooks/:webhookId/:token` | `public` | `{ "text": "Build #12 passed" }` posts as the bot |

```bash
curl -X POST "$WEBHOOK_URL" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"text":"Build *#1482* succeeded on `main` :rocket:"}'
```

A webhook is the one-line option for posting into a single channel. An API key is the general
one: every endpoint, scoped and rate limited per key.

## API keys

Full guide: **[API keys](api-keys.md)**. Admin or owner only.

| Method | Path | Scope | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/workspaces/:id/api-keys` | `api_keys:read` | `?includeRevoked=true` for the full history |
| POST | `/workspaces/:id/api-keys` | `api_keys:write` | Returns the secret **once**; `identity: "bot" \| "self"` |
| GET/PATCH | `/api-keys/:id` | `api_keys:read` / `api_keys:write` | Inspect; rename, re-scope, re-limit, change expiry |
| POST | `/api-keys/:id/rotate` | `api_keys:write` | New secret, old one dies immediately |
| DELETE | `/api-keys/:id` | `api_keys:write` | Revoke |

## Discovery

| Method | Path | Scope | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/meta` | `public` | Auth format, rate limits, links |
| GET | `/meta/routes` | `public` | Every route with its method, path, scope and access class |
| GET | `/meta/scopes` | `public` | The scope catalogue |
| GET | `/meta/openapi.json` | `public` | OpenAPI 3.1, generated from the table the server enforces |

## Files

| Method | Path | Scope | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/files` | `files:write` | `multipart/form-data`: `workspaceId`, optional `conversationId`, `file` |
| GET | `/files/:id/download` | `files:read` | Access-checked stream; images and PDFs inline, rest attachment |
| DELETE | `/files/:id` | `files:write` | Uploader or admin |

## GIFs

Backed by [Klipy](https://klipy.com); disabled and hidden from the composer unless `KLIPY_API_KEY`
is set (`GET /workspaces/:id/bootstrap` reports this as `gifsEnabled`). The app key never leaves
the server. A picked GIF is never fetched or stored: the client sends it as a normal message whose
body is `![title](url)` — a link, not an attachment, matching how Mattermost's own Giphy
integration posted GIFs (and why those old imported messages now render inline too). It does not
count against the workspace's file storage quota.

| Method | Path | Scope | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/workspaces/:id/gifs/search` | `files:read` | `?q=` required, `?page=` (24 per page) |
| GET | `/workspaces/:id/gifs/trending` | `files:read` | `?page=` |

## Activity and search

| Method | Path | Scope | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/workspaces/:id/search` | `messages:read` | `?q=` with operators, `?sort=recent\|relevant` |
| GET/POST | `/workspaces/:id/notifications`, `/notifications/read` | `activity:read` / `activity:write` | Activity feed |
| GET | `/workspaces/:id/threads` | `activity:read` | Threads you started or replied to |
| GET | `/workspaces/:id/saved` | `activity:read` | Saved items ("Later") |
| GET | `/workspaces/:id/drafts` | `activity:read` | Unsent drafts across conversations |
| GET | `/workspaces/:id/unreads` | `activity:read` | All unread messages grouped by conversation |
| GET | `/workspaces/:id/files` | `files:read` | Files across your conversations |
| GET | `/workspaces/:id/scheduled`, DELETE `/scheduled/:id` | `activity:read` / `activity:write` | Scheduled messages |
| GET/POST | `/workspaces/:id/reminders`, POST `/reminders/:id/complete` | `activity:read` / `activity:write` | Reminders |
| GET | `/commands` | any key | Slash command catalogue for autocomplete |

## Rate limits and errors

Errors are `{ "error": string, "code": string }`. Validation failures add `issues`.

Cookie traffic is limited per IP (600 requests/minute, tighter on credential endpoints). Key traffic
is limited per key — 120 requests/minute by default, 60 new messages/minute, a 40/second burst
ceiling and a 6000/minute ceiling across the whole workspace. Every key-authenticated response
carries `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining` and `X-RateLimit-Reset`; a `429` adds
`Retry-After`. Limits are per key and adjustable per key — see [API keys](api-keys.md).

## Message format

Message bodies are plain text with stable entity tokens:

```text
<@user-uuid>                  person mention
<#channel-uuid|name>          channel link
<!here> <!channel> <!everyone> broadcast
<!group:group-uuid|handle>    user group
<https://example.com|label>   labelled link
![alt text](https://example.com/image.gif)   inline image
*bold* _italic_ ~strike~ `code` ```block``` > quote - list
```

`:shortcode:` renders a unicode emoji, or a workspace custom emoji image when one matches.
`![alt](url)` renders inline — this is the format the composer's GIF picker sends, and how
Mattermost's own Giphy integration posted GIFs, so imports using that format render the same way.
