/**
 * PostHog wiring for the chat app.
 *
 * Fluid Chat carries private conversations, so one rule governs this file: **no event
 * ever carries message text, channel names, file names, search terms, or any other free
 * text a person typed.** Only ids, counts, lengths and fixed enum values. If you are
 * adding an event and reaching for a string, stop and send an id or a category instead.
 *
 * That rule is why autocapture and session replay are both off: autocapture ships the
 * text content of whatever got clicked (channel names, message snippets) as event
 * properties, and replay would record DM contents to PostHog's servers. The one string
 * that does go out is the workspace name, attached to the workspace group — group
 * analytics is unreadable without it, and it is billing metadata the operator already has.
 *
 * Everything here degrades to a no-op when NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY is unset, which is the
 * case for every self-hosted install that has not opted in.
 *
 * The second rule is that an event has to answer a question. Navigation and reactions are
 * deliberately not tracked: in a chat app they fire constantly and only ever confirm that
 * chat is being used. Thread engagement is already readable from `message_sent`'s
 * `is_thread_reply`, and the channel/DM split from its `conversation_kind`, without paying
 * for an event per click.
